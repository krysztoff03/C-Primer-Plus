* Have a program request the user to enter an uppercase letter. Use nested loops to produce
* a pyramid pattern like this:
* A
* ABA
* ABCBA
* ABCDCBA
* ABCDEDCBA
* The pattern should extend to the character entered. For example, the preceding pattern
* would result from an input value of E . Hint: Use an outer loop to handle the rows. Use
* three inner loops in a row, one to handle the spaces, one for printing letters in ascending
* order, and one for printing letters in descending order. If your system doesn’t use ASCII
* or a similar system that represents letters in strict number order, see the suggestion in
* programming exercise 3.
